## Introduction

For our first lesson, we will make Three.js works the most straightforward way: no bundler, no dependency, no modules, just an HTML file, and some JavaScript.

## Base files

To begin, create a plain `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>03 - Basic Scene</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

And a simple `script.js` file:

```js
console.log('Hello Three.js')
```

Open the `index.html` in your browser. To do that, you can try to double click on the file. If it doesn't work or it opens with the wrong browser, you can drag and drop the file onto the right browser. Even if Three.js will work on most browsers, I recommend using a developer-friendly browser like **Chrome** or **Firefox**.

Now open the **Developer Tools**.

To do that, you can right click anywhere on the page and choose `Inspect` or you can press `F12` on Windows and `CMD + OPTION + I` on MacOS.

Then navigate to the **Console** tab on top of the **Developer Tools**.

You should keep the **Console** open at all time to se potential errors and warnings.

## How to load Three.js

Now we need to load the Three.js library.
There are many ways of doing it. For now, we will simply download the library and load it using `<script>`.

Go to [https://threejs.org/](https://threejs.org/) and click on the **download** button to download a zip file and unzip it. The file is quite heavy, but don't worry, we only need one file from it.

You should get a folder that looks like this:

![image-1](./files/image-1.png)

Go to the `build/` folder and copy the `three.min.js` file to your project.

You should get something like this:

![image-2](./files/image-2.png)

We can now load the Three.js library at the end of the `<body>`, right before closing it:

```html
<script src="./three.min.js"></script>
<script src="./script.js"></script>
```

Make sure to load `three.min.js` before your `script.js`; otherwise, your script will not be aware of what's inside the `three.min.js` file.

## How to use Three.js

Inside of our `script.js` file, we now have access to a variable named `THREE`. Be careful and always write it using uppercase.

If you `console.log()` this variable, you'll see that there is a lot going on inside:

```js
console.log(THREE)
```

The `THREE` variable contains most of the classes and properties you might need on a classic Three.js project. Unfortunately, not all classes are inside this variable, but we will see later how to access them.

To use one of those classes, you need to instantiate it. For example, if you want to create a scene, you'll write `const scene = new THREE.Scene()`. If you want to create a sphere geometry, you need to write `const sphereGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1.5, 32, 32)` —We'll dig deeper into these later.

## First scene

It's time to create our scene and produce something on the screen.

We need 4 elements to get started:

1. A scene that will contain objects
1. Some objects
1. A camera
1. A renderer

#### Scene

The scene is like a container. You place your objects, models, particles, lights, etc. in it, and at some point, you ask Three.js to render that scene.

To create a scene, use the [Scene](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/scenes/Scene) class:

```js
// Scene
const scene = new THREE.Scene()
```

#### Objects

Objects can be many things. You can have primitive geometries, imported models, particles, lights, and so on.

We will start with a simple red cube.

To create that red cube, we need to create a type of object named [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh). A [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh) is the combination of a geometry (the shape) and a material (how it looks).

There are many geometries and many materials, but we will keep things simple for now and create a [BoxGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry) and a [MeshBasicMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial).

To create the geometry, we use the [BoxGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry) class with the first 3 parameters that correspond to the box's size.

```js
// Object
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)
```

To create the material, we use the [MeshBasicMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial) class with one parameter: an object `{}` containing all the options. All we need is to specify its `color` property.

There are many ways to specify a color in Three.js. You can send it as a JS hexadecimal `0xff0000`, you can send it as a string hexadecimal `'#ff0000'`, you can use color names like `'red'`, or you can send an instance of the [Color](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/math/Color) class —we'll cover more about it later.

```js
// Object
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 })
```

To create the final mesh, we use the [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh) class and send the `geometry` and the `material` as parameters.

```js
// Object
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 })
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
```

You can now add your mesh to the scene by using the `add(...)` method:

```js
scene.add(mesh)
```

If you don't add an object to the scene, you won't be able to see it.

#### Camera

The camera is not visible. It's more like a theoretical point of view. When we will do a render of your scene, it will be from that camera's point of view.

You can have multiple cameras just like on a movie set, and you can switch between those cameras as you please. Usually, we only use one camera.

There are different types of cameras, and we will talk about these in a future lesson. For now, we simply need a camera that handles perspective (making close objects look more prominent than far objects).

To create the camera, we use the [PerspectiveCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera) class.

There are two essential parameters we need to provide.

**The field of view**

The field of view is how large your vision angle is. If you use a very large angle, you'll be able to see in every direction at once but with much distortion, because the result will be drawn on a small rectangle. If you use a small angle, things will look zoomed in.
The field of view (or `fov`) is expressed in degrees and corresponds to the vertical vision angle. For this exercise we will use a `75` degrees angle.

Here's a video to explain what the field of view variation looks like:

**The aspect ratio**

In most cases, the aspect ratio is the width of the canvas divided by its height.
We haven't specified any width or height for now, but we will need to later. In the meantime, we will create an object with temporary values that we can re-use.

Don't forget to add your camera to the scene. Everything should work without adding the camera to the scene, but it might result in bugs later:

```js
// Sizes
const sizes = {
    width: 800,
    height: 600
}

// Camera
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, sizes.width / sizes.height)
scene.add(camera)
```

#### Renderer

The renderer's job is to do the render. Bet you didn't see that coming?

We will simply ask the renderer to render our scene from the camera point of view, and the result will be drawn into a canvas. You can create the canvas by yourself, or let the renderer generate it and then add it to your page. For this exercise, we will add the canvas to the html and send it to the renderer.

Create the `<canvas>` element **before** you load the scripts and give it a class:

```html
<canvas class="webgl"></canvas>
```

To create the renderer, we use the [WebGLRenderer](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer) class with one parameter: an object `{}` containing all the options. We need to specify the `canvas` property corresponding to the `<canvas>` we added to the page.

Create a `canvas` variable at the start of the code, then fetch and store in it the element we created in the HTML using `document.querySelector(...)`.

It's better to assign the canvas to a variable because we'll use it for other purposes in the next lessons.

We also need to update the size of your renderer with the `setSize(...)` method using the `sizes` object we created earlier.
The `setSize(...)` method will automatically resize our `<canvas>` accordingly:

```js
// Canvas
const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas.webgl')

// ...

// Renderer
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
    canvas: canvas
})
renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height)
```

If you refresh the page, you should see a black canvas of 800px width and 600px large.

![step-01](./files/step-01.png)

## First render

It's time to work on our first render. Call the `render(...)` method on the renderer and send it the `scene` and the `camera` as parameters:

```js
renderer.render(scene, camera)
```

Still nothing? Here's the issue: we haven't specified our object's position, nor our camera's. Both are in the default position, which is the center of the scene and we can't see an object from its inside (by default).

We need to move things.

To do that, we have access to multiple properties on each object, such as `position`, `rotation`, and `scale`. For now, use the `position` property to move the camera backward.

The `position` property is an object with three relevant properties: `x`, `y` and `z`. By default, Three.js considers the forward/backward axis to be `z`.

To move the camera backward, we need to provide a positive value to that property. You can do that anywhere once you've created the `camera` variable, yet it has to happen before you do the render:

```js
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, sizes.width / sizes.height)
camera.position.z = 3
scene.add(camera)
```

![step-02](./files/step-02.png)

Congratulations, you should see your first render. It looks like a square, and that's because the camera aligns perfectly with the cube, and you can see only one side of it.

Don't worry about the render's size; we'll learn how to make the canvas fit the viewport later.

In the next lessons, you will learn more about the `position`, `rotation` and `scale` properties, how to change them, and animate the scene.
